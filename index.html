        <div class="main-text">The year 2020 has been a roller coaster. But it didn't diminish our commitment to drive change through art. Strokes organised several events, competitions and workshops. The events were focussed on inspiring others amidst the difficult time and make them rememeber that even though miles apart, we are all connected by some form of art.</div>
